## üîÑ What is Sensor Fusion?
Sensor Fusion is the process of combining data from multiple sensors (like cameras, radar, LiDAR, ultrasonic, GPS, IMU) to create a more accurate, reliable, and comprehensive understanding of the vehicle‚Äôs environment than any single sensor could provide alone.

---

## üß† Why is Sensor Fusion Important?
Each sensor has strengths and weaknesses:

| Sensor      | Strengths                              | Weaknesses                      |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Camera      | High resolution, object classification | Sensitive to lighting/weather   |
| Radar       | Accurate distance/speed, all-weather   | Limited object classification   |
| LiDAR       | Precise 3D mapping                     | Costly, weather-dependent       |
| Ultrasonic  | Effective close-range detection        | Short range, low resolution     |

Sensor fusion leverages the complementary strengths of these sensors to overcome individual limitations and provide a more reliable perception of the environment.

By fusing their data, the system can:
- Reduce uncertainty
- Improve detection accuracy
- Handle sensor failures or noise
- Enable robust decision-making

## ‚öôÔ∏è Types of Sensor Fusion
1. **Low-Level (Raw Data) Fusion**
   - Combines raw sensor data (e.g., pixel values, point clouds).
   - High accuracy but computationally intensive.
   - Example: Fusing LiDAR point clouds with camera pixels for 3D semantic segmentation.
2. **Mid-Level (Feature-Level) Fusion**
   - Combines extracted features (e.g., edges, bounding boxes).
   - Balances performance and complexity.
   - Example: Merging radar-detected object positions with camera-detected object classes.
3. **High-Level (Decision-Level) Fusion**
   - Combines final decisions or object lists from each sensor.
   - Easier to implement but may lose detail.
   - Example: If both radar and camera detect a vehicle, confirm its presence.

## üßÆ Common Sensor Fusion Techniques
- **Kalman Filter:** For tracking and estimating object positions over time.
- **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF):** Handles non-linear systems (common in vehicle dynamics).
- **Particle Filter:** For more complex, non-Gaussian distributions.
- **Bayesian Inference:** Probabilistic fusion of sensor data.
- **Deep Learning:** Neural networks trained to fuse multi-modal sensor inputs.

## üöò Example in ADAS: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)
1. Radar detects a vehicle 50m ahead moving at 80 km/h.
2. Camera confirms it‚Äôs a car and not a sign or shadow.
3. Sensor Fusion Module combines this data to:
   - Confirm object type and position.
   - Estimate time-to-collision.
   - Adjust vehicle speed accordingly.

This document provides an overview of key algorithms used for sensor data fusion in ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems). These algorithms enable robust integration of radar, LiDAR, and camera data for accurate perception and decision-making in automotive applications.

---

## 1. Kalman Filter

**Purpose:**
- Used for tracking objects by combining position and velocity estimates from radar and camera.

**How it works:**
- The Kalman filter is a recursive algorithm that estimates the state of a dynamic system from noisy measurements.
- In ADAS, it predicts the position and velocity of detected objects, updating estimates as new sensor data arrives.
- It is widely used for multi-sensor tracking, such as fusing radar and camera data to maintain accurate object trajectories.

**Example Application:**
- Vehicle tracking for adaptive cruise control and collision avoidance.

---

## 2. Bayesian Inference

**Purpose:**
- Probabilistically merges sensor data to improve confidence in object detection and classification.

**How it works:**
- Bayesian inference uses probability theory to update beliefs about the environment based on new evidence from sensors.
- It combines data from multiple sources, accounting for uncertainty and sensor reliability.
- Useful for decision-making under uncertainty, such as confirming the presence of an obstacle detected by both radar and camera.

**Example Application:**
- Pedestrian detection in complex environments.

---

## 3. Neural Networks

**Purpose:**
- Deep learning models can learn to fuse features from multiple sensors for tasks like pedestrian detection or free-space estimation.

**How it works:**
- Neural networks, especially CNNs and multimodal architectures, can process and combine data from radar, LiDAR, and cameras.
- They learn to extract and merge features, improving detection accuracy and robustness.
- Used for end-to-end perception tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object classification.

**Example Application:**
- Lane detection and drivable area estimation using camera and LiDAR data.

---

## 4. Rule-Based Logic

**Purpose:**
- Applies predefined rules to combine sensor outputs for decision-making.

**How it works:**
- Rule-based systems use logical conditions to interpret sensor data and trigger actions.
- For example, if both radar and camera detect an obstacle, the system may initiate emergency braking.
- Simple and interpretable, but less flexible than probabilistic or learning-based methods.

**Example Application:**
- Forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking.
