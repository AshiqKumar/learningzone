# Sensor Data Fusion for ADAS Decision-Making

This document explains how data fusion from multiple sensors—radar, LiDAR, and camera—is used to enable robust decision-making for ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) features. It covers fusion strategies, algorithms, and practical examples relevant to automotive applications.

## 1. Introduction to Sensor Fusion in ADAS

Sensor fusion is the process of combining data from different sensors to create a comprehensive and reliable understanding of the vehicle’s environment. Each sensor type has unique strengths and limitations:
- **Camera:** Provides rich visual information for object classification, lane detection, and traffic sign recognition. Limited in poor lighting or adverse weather.
- **Radar:** Measures object distance and relative velocity accurately, works well in poor visibility, but has lower spatial resolution.
- **LiDAR:** Offers precise 3D mapping and object detection, but can be expensive and affected by weather conditions.

By fusing data from these sensors, ADAS systems can overcome individual limitations and make safer, more informed decisions.

## 2. Fusion Strategies

### a. Low-Level (Raw Data) Fusion
Combines raw sensor outputs before any processing. Example: merging point clouds from LiDAR and radar returns for early object detection.

### b. Mid-Level (Feature) Fusion
Combines features extracted from each sensor, such as bounding boxes, object classes, or lane positions. Example: fusing camera-based object classification with radar-based velocity estimates.

### c. High-Level (Decision) Fusion
Combines decisions or outputs from independent sensor-specific algorithms. Example: merging camera-based lane departure warnings with radar-based collision alerts.

## 3. Common Fusion Algorithms

- **Kalman Filter:** Used for tracking objects by combining position and velocity estimates from radar and camera.
- **Bayesian Inference:** Probabilistically merges sensor data to improve confidence in object detection and classification.
- **Neural Networks:** Deep learning models can learn to fuse features from multiple sensors for tasks like pedestrian detection or free-space estimation.
- **Rule-Based Logic:** Applies predefined rules to combine sensor outputs for decision-making (e.g., braking if both radar and camera detect an obstacle).

## 4. Example: Sensor Fusion for Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB)

1. **Detection:**
   - Camera detects a pedestrian ahead.
   - Radar confirms an object at a matching distance and estimates its velocity.
   - LiDAR provides precise 3D location.
2. **Fusion:**
   - Features from all sensors are combined to confirm the presence, position, and movement of the pedestrian.
3. **Decision:**
   - If the fused data indicates a high risk of collision, the ADAS system triggers emergency braking.

## 5. Challenges in Sensor Fusion

- **Sensor Synchronization:** Ensuring all sensors are time-aligned for accurate fusion.
- **Data Association:** Matching objects detected by different sensors.
- **Environmental Factors:** Handling adverse weather, lighting, and sensor failures.
- **Computational Complexity:** Real-time fusion requires efficient algorithms and hardware.
