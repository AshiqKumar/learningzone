## üîç Technical & Software Questions

### 1. What is the significance of camera calibration in ADAS?
**Sample Answer:**
Camera calibration is crucial in ADAS because it ensures accurate mapping between the 2D image captured by the camera and the 3D world. Calibration helps correct lens distortions and determines intrinsic parameters (like focal length and optical center) and extrinsic parameters (like position and orientation of the camera). Without proper calibration, tasks like lane detection, object localization, and distance estimation can be significantly off, leading to unreliable system behavior.

### 2. How do you detect lanes using a front-facing camera?
**Sample Answer:**
Lane detection typically involves several steps: first, we apply preprocessing techniques like Gaussian blur and edge detection (e.g., Canny). Then, we use perspective transformation to get a bird‚Äôs-eye view. After that, algorithms like Hough Transform or deep learning models (e.g., SCNN or LaneNet) are used to identify lane markings. Post-processing includes curve fitting and tracking across frames to ensure temporal consistency. The system must also handle challenges like shadows, worn-out markings, and varying lighting conditions.

### 3. How do you optimize image processing algorithms for real-time performance in embedded systems?
**Sample Answer:**
Optimization starts with algorithmic efficiency‚Äîchoosing lightweight models or algorithms with lower computational complexity. Techniques include using fixed-point arithmetic instead of floating-point, leveraging hardware accelerators like GPUs or DSPs, and minimizing memory access. We also use parallel processing and reduce frame resolution or frame rate when acceptable. Profiling tools help identify bottlenecks, and frameworks like OpenCV or TensorRT can be used for deployment optimization.

### 4. Which neural networks are commonly used for image segmentation in ADAS?
**Sample Answer:**
For semantic segmentation in ADAS, networks like U-Net, SegNet, and DeepLabv3+ are popular. These models balance accuracy and computational efficiency. For real-time applications, lightweight models like ENet or Fast-SCNN are preferred. These networks help in tasks like road segmentation, lane detection, and identifying drivable areas. The choice depends on the trade-off between inference speed and segmentation accuracy.

### 5. How would you improve pedestrian detection in low-light conditions?
**Sample Answer:**
Improving pedestrian detection in low-light involves both hardware and software strategies. On the hardware side, using infrared or thermal cameras can help. On the software side, image enhancement techniques like histogram equalization or deep learning-based low-light image enhancement can be applied. Additionally, training detection models on low-light datasets or using data augmentation to simulate such conditions improves robustness.

## üîß Hardware & Integration Questions

### 1. What are the key considerations when selecting a camera sensor for ADAS applications?
**Sample Answer:**
When selecting a camera sensor for ADAS, key factors include resolution, frame rate, dynamic range, and sensitivity to low light. For example, high dynamic range (HDR) is essential for handling extreme lighting conditions like tunnels or direct sunlight. Low latency and high frame rates are important for real-time responsiveness. Additionally, the sensor must be automotive-grade, with AEC-Q100 qualification, and capable of operating in a wide temperature range.

### 2. How do you manage thermal issues in camera modules used in vehicles?
**Sample Answer:**
Thermal management is critical in automotive environments. We use heat sinks, thermal pads, and proper PCB layout to dissipate heat. In some cases, active cooling or thermal throttling is implemented. Software also plays a role‚Äîmonitoring temperature sensors and adjusting frame rates or resolution dynamically to reduce heat generation. Ensuring the camera housing is designed for airflow and using low-power image processors also helps.

### 3. What is rolling shutter, and why is it a concern in ADAS?
**Sample Answer:**
Rolling shutter captures the image line by line, which can cause distortion when either the camera or objects are moving quickly. This is problematic in ADAS, especially for high-speed scenarios like highway driving or detecting fast-moving vehicles. To mitigate this, we prefer global shutter sensors or apply software correction techniques. However, global shutter sensors are more expensive and power-hungry, so trade-offs are considered based on the use case.

### 4. How do you test and validate a camera module for automotive use?
**Sample Answer:**
Validation involves both lab and field testing. In the lab, we test for image quality (sharpness, color accuracy, noise), environmental resilience (temperature, humidity, vibration), and EMI/EMC compliance. Field testing includes driving in diverse conditions‚Äîday/night, rain, fog, tunnels‚Äîto evaluate real-world performance. We also perform long-duration tests to assess reliability and use automated tools to analyze frame drops, latency, and synchronization with other sensors.

### 5. How do you ensure synchronization between multiple cameras and other sensors like LiDAR or radar?
**Sample Answer:**
Synchronization is achieved using hardware triggers or time-stamping via a common clock source like GPS or PTP (Precision Time Protocol). This ensures all sensors capture data at the same moment, which is crucial for sensor fusion. In software, we align frames based on timestamps and compensate for latency differences. Accurate synchronization improves object tracking, depth estimation, and overall system reliability.

Object classification is typically performed using deep learning models such as CNNs or YOLO, which can identify and categorize objects in real time. Tracking is achieved using algorithms like Kalman filters, SORT, or DeepSORT, which maintain object identities across frames and predict their future positions. Combining detection and tracking improves robustness in dynamic environments.

### 3. What is sensor fusion and why is it important for perception?
**Sample Answer:**
Sensor fusion combines data from multiple sensors (cameras, radar, LiDAR) to create a more accurate and reliable understanding of the environment. It helps overcome limitations of individual sensors, such as poor visibility for cameras in fog or limited range for radar. Fusion algorithms use techniques like Kalman filtering, Bayesian inference, or neural networks to merge sensor data for better perception and decision-making.

### 4. How do you handle occlusions in perception algorithms?
**Sample Answer:**
Occlusions occur when objects are partially or fully blocked from view. Perception algorithms address this by using temporal information (tracking across frames), sensor fusion (combining camera and radar/LiDAR data), and predictive models to estimate the position of occluded objects. Deep learning models trained on occluded scenarios also improve robustness.

### 5. What are the challenges of perception in urban environments?
**Sample Answer:**
Urban environments present challenges such as dense traffic, frequent occlusions, complex road layouts, and diverse object types. Perception systems must handle rapid changes, ambiguous situations, and unpredictable behavior from pedestrians and vehicles. Robust algorithms, high-quality training data, and real-time processing are essential to ensure safety and reliability.
