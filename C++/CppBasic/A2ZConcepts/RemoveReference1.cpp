/*
Q) if x got moved it should be empty, but how 100 is still out put int&& p = move(x);

Ans :- 
 This is a common point of confusion in C++.

When you write:
int x = 100;
int&& p = std::move(x);
and then print x and p, you see: 100 100 as output

Why?
std::move(x) does not move the value; it just casts x to an rvalue reference (int&&).
The actual "move" (i.e., transferring or emptying resources) only happens if you use x in a context where a move operation is defined 
(like moving from a std::string or std::vector).
For built-in types like int, there is no move semanticsâ€”copying and moving are the same, and the value is simply copied.

x is not emptied or changed; both x and p still have the value 100.
Only user-defined types with move constructors/assignments can have their resources "moved from" (and possibly left empty or in a valid but unspecified state).
