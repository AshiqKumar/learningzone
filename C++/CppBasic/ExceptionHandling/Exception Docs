There are standard exceptions in C++ under <exception> which we can use in our programs. They are arranged in a parent-child class hierarchy which is depicted below:

logic_error - Exception happens in the internal logical of a program.
domain_error - Exception due to use of invalid domain.
invalid argument - Exception due to invalid argument.
out_of_range - Exception due to out of range i.e. size requirement exceeds allocation.
length_error - Exception due to length error.
runtime_error - Exception happens during runtime.
range_error - Exception due to range errors in internal computations.
overflow_error - Exception due to arithmetic overflow errors.
underflow_error - Exception due to arithmetic underflow errors
bad_alloc - Exception happens when memory allocation with new() fails.
bad_cast - Exception happens when dynamic cast fails.
